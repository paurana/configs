# Configuration for Alacritty, the GPU enhanced terminal emulator.

# Import additional configuration files
#
# Imports are loaded in order, skipping all missing files, with the importing
# file being loaded last. If a field is already present in a previous import, it
# will be replaced.
#
# All imports must either be absolute paths starting with `/`, or paths relative
# to the user's home directory starting with `~/`.
#import:
#  - /path/to/alacritty.yml
# Any items in the `env` entry below will be added as
# environment variables. Some entries may override variables
# set by alacritty itself.
# env:
#   TERM: xterm-256color
#   # TERM variable
#
# This value is used to set the `$TERM` environment variable for
# each instance of Alacritty. If it is not present, alacritty will
# check the local terminfo database and use `alacritty` if it is
# available, otherwise `xterm-256color` is used.
# TERM: alacritty
window:
  # Window dimensions (changes require restart)
  #
  # Number of lines/columns (not pixels) in the terminal. The number of columns
  # must be at least `2`, while using a value of `0` for columns and lines will
  # fall back to the window manager's recommended size.
  # dimensions:
  #   columns: 0
  #   lines: 0
  # Window position (changes require restart)

  # Specified in number of pixels.
  # If the position is not set, the window manager will handle the placement.
  #position:
  #  x: 0
  #  y: 0
  # Window padding (changes require restart)
  #
  # Blank space added around the window in pixels. This padding is scaled
  # by DPI and the specified value is always added at both opposing sides.
  #padding:
  #  x: 0
  #  y: 0
  # Spread additional padding evenly around the terminal content.
